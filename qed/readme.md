This folder contains quantum mechanics simulations made for the "Quantum Mechanics for Everyone"
course by Georgetown University.

This work was inspired and based on Richard P. Feynman's book "QED: The Strange Theory of Light and
Matter".

These simulations involve variations on the double slit experiment and examples of interference,
which are visually explained via Feynman's path integral formulation of quantum mechanics.

The bulk of the software resides in the qed_engine.js file, which contains the QED Engine code that
is used by the simulations to assemble a "scene", and run simulations on the objects being used.

The "lib" folder contains third-party libraries, which should be distributed with their respective
licenses.
