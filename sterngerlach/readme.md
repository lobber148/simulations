This folder contains the Stern-Gerlach Engine and simulations for the "Quantum Mechanics for
Everyone" course.

These are based on Daniel F. Styer's "The Strange World of Quantum Mechanics".

The bulk of the code is on the sge_engine.js file, a 3D engine which simulates many possible
setups for chained Stern-Gerlach experiments.

The "lib" folder contains third-party libraries, which should be distributed with their respective
licenses.
